%setup
    # This section is executed on the host system outside of the container after the base OS has been installed
    # touch ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/tacos.txt # in the image
    # touch avocados.txt # outside of the image (the current working directory)
    
%files
    # You can add files to the container (added before %post) using the %files section.
    # In the above, we see that copying something to $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS during
    # %setup was successful to move the file into the container, but copying during %post was not.
